## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I got reminded that when we built a any webpage or project with HTML and CSS, always start with the appropriate HTML then style it with CSS. 

First get the sections ready with HTML and style accordingly with CSS, in my opinion I think this is a best approach.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for knowing how to set the qr scanner card in the center of the background. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.freecodecamp.org) - Its a free website where you can learn and have in hand experience from doing things.
